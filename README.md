# Gun murders in the U.S. by state.


This is one of my first case studies to go in my online portfolio. This case study is from a Harvard class on data analysis. This case study was to visualize total gun murders and population by state. By extracting data using the R programming language and R Studio, we can find out which states are the safest and most dangerous in terms of gun murders. Interestingly, the state with the most murders is not the most dangerous state in the US.


This case study also taught me how to sort, sort, index and order data.

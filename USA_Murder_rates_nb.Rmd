This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r}
# loading the dslabs package and the murders dataset
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
```

```{r}
# determining that the murders dataset is of the "data frame" class
class(murders)
# finding out more about the structure of the object
str(murders)
# showing the first 6 lines of the dataset
head(murders)
```

```{r}
# using the accessor operator to obtain the population column
murders$population

# displaying the variable names in the murders dataset
names(murders)
```

```{r}
# determining how many entries are in a vector
pop <- murders$population
length(pop)
# vectors can be of class numeric and character
class(pop)
class(murders$state)
```

```{r}
# logical vectors are either TRUE or FALSE
z <- 3 == 2
z
class(z)
```

```{r}
# factors are another type of class
class(murders$region)
# obtaining the levels of a factor
levels(murders$region)
```

```{r}
sort(murders$total)
```

```{r}

x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
sort(x)    # puts elements in order
```

```{r}
index <- order(x)    # returns index that will put x in order
x[index]    # rearranging by this index puts elements in order
order(x)
```

```{r}
murders$state[1:10]
murders$abb[1:10]

index <- order(murders$total)
murders$abb[index]    # order abbreviations by total murders
```

```{r}
max(murders$total)    # highest number of total murders
i_max <- which.max(murders$total)    # index with highest number of murders
murders$state[i_max]    # state name with highest number of total murders
```
```{r}
x <- c(31, 4, 15, 92, 65)
x
rank(x)    # returns ranks (smallest to largest)
```

```{r}
ind <- order(murders$total) 
murders$abb[ind] 
murders$state[which.max(murders$population)]
```

```{r}
murder_rate <- murders$total / murders$population * 100000
murders$abb[order(murder_rate)]
ind <- murder_rate <= 0.71
murders$state[ind]
west <- murders$region == "West"
safe <- murder_rate <= 1
safe

```
```{r}
ind <- which(murders$state == "California")
murder_rate[ind]
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
x <- murders$population / 10^6
y <- murders$total
with(murders, plot(population, total))
```
```{r}
x <- with(murders, total / population * 100000)
hist(x)
```

```{r}
murders$state[which.max(x)]
```

```{r}
murders$rate <- with(murders, total / population * 100000)
boxplot(rate~region, data = murders)
```

```{r}
